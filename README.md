In order to do estimation download all the python files in your system along with the Pantheon+ data files.
Add the paths of "Pantheon+SH0ES.txt" and "Pantheon+SH0ES_STAT+SYS.txt" files to the main.py file.
Run main.py and choose the cosmology.
Currently two cosmological models are available - Lambda CDM and Tsallis Holographic Dark energy Model. We will add more models in the future.
Currently estimation is done using just Panthoen+ Supernova data. In future we will add BAO and Lyman-Alpha data files as well.
