1. To do parameter estimation, download all the Python files in your system along with the Pantheon+ data files.
2. Add paths of the "Pantheon+SH0ES.txt" and "Pantheon+SH0ES_STAT+SYS.txt" files to the main.py file.
3. Run main.py and choose the cosmology.
4. Two cosmological models are currently available - Lambda CDM and Tsallis Holographic Dark energy Model. We will add more models in the future.
5. Currently, estimation is done using just Panthoen+ Supernova data. In future, we will add BAO and Lyman-Alpha data files as well.
